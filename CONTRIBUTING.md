If you would like to contribute to this repository, please first discuss the changes you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making the respective change. For newcomers we recommend having a look at the [GitHub flow] first.

Please, note that like many other projects nowadays we have a [Code of Conduct], comparable to the old days' [Netiquette]. We kindly ask you to read it carefully and to follow it in in every interaction with this project, its team members, and our contributors.

In case you are contributing code to this project for the first time, it would be nice if you could briefly introduce yourself, telling us about your interest in the project and related experiences.

## Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct] has been adapted from the [Contributor Covenant], version 1.4,
available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][CoC-version].

The Contributor Covenant was created by [Coraline Ada Ehmke] in 2014 and is released under the [CC BY 4.0][cc-by-4.0] license.

For answers to common questions about their Code of Conduct, please see [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq][CoC-FAQ].

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure that any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update this project's [README] with details about your changes to the project.
3. Increase the version number in the [README] to the new version that your Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer].
4. You may merge the Pull Request, once you have the [Sign-off] of one other developer. By doing so you or the respective commiter indicate that you accept the [Developer's Certificate of Origin][DCO] and certify that no portion of your patch has been taken from a third pary without permission and that your commit can be published and legally redistributed under the license terms of this project.
